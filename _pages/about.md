Wataru Kawabe (川辺 航) is a third-year doctoral student at The University of Tokyo, supervised by [Prof. Yusuke Sugano](https://www.yusuke-sugano.info/). His interest lies in interactive machine learning systems and human-centered machine-learning applications. He is especially focused on exploring ways to make AI and other information technologies more accessible and user-friendly for beginners who lack a technical background or knowledge.
